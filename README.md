## xstatR Development Repository

This repo is used to build a docker image for R and xlisp-stat and communications bridge between them.

Assuming you are in your xstatR local repo, execute:  

./start.sh build  

to build the image. After the initial build, you only needs to run:  

./start.sh run  
to run the image.
